# Theme
"The more you have, the worse it is"

# Main game idea

Roguelite kinda game, but every pickup you get you must bind a new key to.
So the more inventory you have, the more thinking you have to do.

Sword
Gun
Reuseable Health kits  (Large and Small)
Grenade

Monsters to get started:
Rat



Items later:
Ammo box
Throwable weapons (knives, spears)
Boots of speed
Trap (eg, slow trap)
Shield
